With the majority of the world population growing concerned with what they consume because of cancers and other diseases that have been on the rise farming has also become a popular factor in food production.

Fresh produce is always welcome to mist restaurants. With that being said so many farming methods have become known to society. Hydroponics and organic being on the list.

The debate on food safety and crop growing practices has never been more intense. Individuals are inclined to eat more healthy produce, even when they are dining out, giving rise to a host of restaurants that promise organically grown food ingredients in their cuisine.

Indeed, organic farming methods have gained immense popularity over the past few years and are often compared to Hydroponics to ascertain which is a more viable and healthy form of agriculture.

## Hydroponic vs Organic Farming

To begin with, it's probably imperative to understand the process behind what organic farming and Hydroponics actually entails.

### Hydroponics

Hydroponics is growing a plant in the absence of soil. Plants are planted in an inert medium, like rocks, Coco Coir, or Grodan, etc. The plant receives its nutritional quota from nutrient salts dissolved in water. Hydroponics is an incredibly fast, high-yielding way to get the most plant growth out of a small space. This process is essentially taking only the key components of what happens in nature and recreating those conditions scientifically.

Hydroponics is described as the process of growing plants or crops in water without the use of soil, while organic farming involves choosing not to use inorganic fertilizers in the growing process. In order to be considered certified organic, a plant can be grown using only unrefined minerals.

Hydroponics plants are grown in nutrient solutions usually indoors, completely free from chemicals and pesticides making them much safer. Plants also grow quicker in Hydroponic farming thanks to the controlled environment, in turn, the crop yield is significantly increased leading to more production from the same amount of space.

There is a growing body of evidence that seems to indicate that closed-loop water recirculation systems like hydroponics and aquaponics which is the coupling of fish production with vegetable production may in fact offer an advantage over soil-based organic growing.

Mostly since the water chemistry of both these systems can be manipulated to boost natural plant bioactives for health benefits. Thus plants grown through Hydroponics have better nutritional value. It has been proven that vitamin content is 50% more in hydroponically grown plants as compared to conventional ones.

Hydroponics boils down to the fact that both farming practices aim to protect the earth's fragile environment. However, there are some ways in which Hydroponics manages to triumph over organic agriculture in environmental protection endeavors. It uses 90% less water than traditional agriculture hence conserving the world's most important resource from depletion. It also manages to prevent soil from degradation, preserving valuable topsoil for plants that cannot be hydroponically grown.

Given all the added benefits of Hydroponics, the bottom line when it comes to the organic farming and Hydroponics debate is the fact Hydroponics manages to better the former in numerous ways making it considerably more attractive agricultural method of growing plants.

### Organic Farming

Organics is the process of cultivating the soil. In this scenario, the plant receives its nutrition from the composition of the medium it is planted in. The soil is constantly composting and being broken down by a series of micro-organisms and beneficial bugs, creating a slow-release effect for available nutrients. This process is essentially taking what happens in nature and providing the soil with the necessary means for replication.

Organically grown food is best if you can get it, but there is a looming battle over hydroponic and aquaponic agriculture wanting to use the highly valuable organic label. “Organic farming allows the use of manure as a natural fertilizer. This has caused a recurring health problem due to E. coli and salmonella outbreaks. Hydroponic growers have completely eliminated the need for soil and its microorganisms.”

Whether or not organic produce, in general, is actually more nutritious than conventionally grown food has never been scientifically settled. But better nutrition isn’t the primary reason to choose organic produce. The point is to avoid the pesticides and herbicides used and their potentially adverse effects on health and the planet.

Organic farmers who grow their produce in soil argue that their vegetables have better flavor and superior nutritional content than those that are hydroponically grown. The claim that organically grown vegetables have a superior flavor is a subjective judgment, and there’s the fact that flavor can vary from crop to crop. While hydroponic growers often say they breed their tomatoes for flavor, it has been found that while the fruit often looks attractive, the flavor usually is insipid and doesn’t compare to the best soil-grown organic or homegrown tomatoes.

Nothing beats the burst of summer flavor that comes with tomatoes sun-ripened in your own garden or in the fields of a good, local organic farmer. This could change if hydroponic growers would focus on better varieties. While we can understand the objections of the organic community to calling produce grown without soil organic.

The issue however is that a number of these unrefined minerals, although natural, can be toxic in nature. For example, mined phosphate contains excessive amounts of fluoride and radioactive radium, both of which can be extremely harmful to humans.

Even the use of organic fertilizers such as manure poses the risk of E-coli and salmonella outbreaks. It’s also best to think hydroponic growth has a big future and can be done without chemical fertilizers and pesticides.

## Final Thoughts

With the rise of the internet, information seems to be available at fingertips for everyone. Yet in the debate of Organic farming vs. Hydroponics, there seems to be a host of misinformation. This article by Pegasus Agriculture aims to uncover some of the myths and paint a clearer picture of why Hydroponics is a superior option to organic farming.
