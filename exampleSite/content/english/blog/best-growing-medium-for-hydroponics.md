Are you looking for the best growing medium for hydroponics? Agriculture is a delicate dance to come up with a specific product at the end of the day. Where you practice it will determine the output as it presents different variables. Hydroponics is a way of growing plants, in a more controlled environment, without soil, so that you have a bit more control over the result.

In this article, we take a look at the best growing medium for hydroponics. Since you’ve done away with soil, you will need a growing medium such as Rockwool, or expanded clay aggregate. The medium that you choose has its advantages and disadvantages. Let's take a look at what some of the top media have to offer. It's important to know that you can not substitute soil with a medium.

## In a hurry

Do you need a quick list so that you know what to look for in the growing medium for hydroponics? The medium should hold the roots of the plant, so make sure that what you go for, can do this. You also want to make sure that the growing media is porous, to allow the nutrients and water to freely pass through and nourish the plant. Also check on the medium’s water holding capacity (WHC), which will help you know how well the medium holds moisture.

You also want to check on air-filled porosity (AFP), which is the amount of volume that has air. If this is low, then there's less oxygen available for the plant, and it could drown. You also want to check on the cation exchange capacity (CEC) which indicates how well the medium captures positive ions. A low CEC gives you more control over the plant's nutrients.

## Our top pick

We have gone through the different media for growing plants hydroponically. Our top pick is perlite and we like it because of its versatility. Now that we know what you should look for in a growing medium, let's look at the different media available

## Rockwool

Rockwool is porous and has a low CEC and a high WHC. This allows it to hold water well, meaning that you will not need to irrigate it as often. It also means that water and nutrients easily pass through it and are not held back. The low CEC also makes it easy to control what is available to the plant.

The downsides with using Rockwool, are that it needs to be presoaked in water with a pH of about 5 for up to 24 hours before you use it. This is to lower the high pH which can make it impossible for the plants to survive.

## Pros

* It has a low CEC allowing you to control what's available for the plant.
* It easily saturates
* It has a high WHC, which means there is a low chance of under watering the plants.
* It encourages the growth of roots in whatever way they need to grow.

## Cons

* It is not biodegradable
* It can irritate the skin

## Lightweight expanded clay aggregate

This medium is also commonly called clay pebbles. This medium has a low CEC and WHC, but it has a high AFP. This means that it easily lets water pass through it, and there is no chance of overwatering. One of the great things about clay pebbles is that you can reuse them. They also encourage healthy oxygen flow through the plant's roots.

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, clay pebbles may let a little too much water pass through, meaning that you need to irrigate the plant more often than you need to if you were using another medium. They drain very quickly. The best way to use this medium is in deep water culture, where the plant is constantly submerged in water, that way draining is never an issue.

## Pros

* It's porous and allows for the free flow of oxygen
* You can never overwater the plants because the pebbles provide good drainage
* They last long and can be reused
* They are environmentally friendly.

## Cons

* They drain quickly
* They can cause problems with plumbing

## Coconut fiber

Coconut fiber, is exactly what it sounds like, fiber from a coconut, to put it simply. It is taken from coconut husks and as such, it is biodegradable, which is a good plus for the environmental farmer. It has a similar feel to potting soil and lets oxygen pass through it very well. It has a high WHC as well as a high CEC meaning that it can retain large amounts of nutrients

One of the reasons why coconut fiber or coir is popular is that it easily aerates the plants. Oxygen plays a big part in the plant's growth. It also gives a purpose for the parts of the coconut that is usually thrown out. This makes it an environmentally friendly medium.

## Pros

* It's biodegradable even though it will take a long time to do so
* It easily allows oxygen to pass through.
* It has good root propagation
* It has a long lifespan and can be reused

## Cons

* You are more likely to overwater a plant with this medium than with other media.
* It is better used on drip systems where you can control the water.

## Perlite

One of the great things about perlite is that it can be added to other growing mediums such as soil, or it can be used on its own. This makes it a versatile medium. Perlite is a volcanic rock, and it is lightweight. It has low CEC and high AFP. Perlite absorbs water easily, but it floats in water. This means that you can not use it in a system that will be submerged in water.

You can easily control the nutrients when you use perlite. Also, it does well absorbing water. It’s a good medium for water-wicking systems.

## Pros

* It is versatile and can be used with both soil and as a medium on its own.
* You can easily control nutrients
* It has a low CEC
* It has a high AFP
* It can be reused

## Cons

* It floats and so cannot be used in systems that are submerged in water
* Plants with aggressive root systems can cause blockages.

## Pine shavings

The importance of choosing the right growing medium for your hydroponics system can impact how well you grow your plants. One of the great things about pine shavings is that they are an affordable medium. They are best used for drip systems. It's important to make sure that the pine shavings are not made with any chemicals and that they are kiln-dried, this is to make sure there isn’t any sap left, which is bad for plants.

Pine shavings absorb water quickly and as such the plants can be prone to overwatering if you're not careful. This means that you need to make sure that you have a good drainage system.

## Pros

* They are sustainable
* They are affordable
* They maintain the structure
* They are organic

## Cons

* They are biodegradable especially when they come in contact with water.
* If they are not kiln dried, there is a possibility that the sap may harm the plants.

## Pumice stone

Whilst pumice stone is similar to perlite, it is not the same thing. It holds nutrients well, and it is also porous. It is in these holes that nutrient solution finds pockets to rest in. it retains moisture but at the same time it also has a good drainage system. The reservoirs of soil nutrients, allow you to have more control over the way nutrients are dispersed.

Using pumice stone, keeps the plant aerated and drains water well. The other great thing about it is that you can reuse the stones.

## Pros

* You can reuse them
* They are sustainable
* They are aerated
* They retain nutrients well

## Cons

* It doesn’t work well with all hydroponic systems
