Are you wondering which farming method is better between hydroponics and traditional methods? Well follow through with this guide and we will give you the obvious answer.

Hydroponic farming is basically a type of Horticulture and a subset of hydroculture, which is a method of growing plants without soil, by using mineral nutrient solutions in a water solvent. Terrestrial plants may be grown with only their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid, or the roots may be physically supported by an inert medium such as perlite, gravel, or other substrates.

On the other hand, traditional farming is the most practiced form of agriculture around the world, became commonplace following the two world wars, as it was during that era that knowledge about chemistry greatly increased.

Traditional agriculture is based on treating the soil and plants with products that are more likely than not noxious, and more likely than not synthetically produced in a laboratory. These products are used to prevent disease or pests from blighting the plant.

## Three Key Differences to Soil

### Water

Typically plants get most of their water from their roots. In traditional soil farming, where waterfalls above ground, little water actually gets down to the roots. In the Hydroponic system plant, roots are directly suspended in water.

As a result in a Hydroponic system all the water is constantly and directly available for plant consumption and not lost to natural ground seepage or evaporation. This key difference reduces overall water consumption by approximately 97% compared to traditional soil farming.

### Packing Density

In traditional soil farming, plants grow large root structures to access water. Due to these large root structures, soil-based farmers need to plant crops far from each other. In a Hydroponic system, plants are suspended in water and therefore grow significantly smaller root structures. This allows plants to be packed closely together.

### Grow Time

The other key difference between Hydroponics relative to traditional soil farming is the actual growth times of the plants. In Hydroponic systems, plants have consistent access to the three things essentials for all plants: nutrients, water, and oxygen.

In traditional soil farming, crops rely on natural rainfall or consistent watering and manually added fertilizer. These crops are in constant competition for these limited and fluctuating resources.

## Why Hydroponics is better

### 1. Water Use Is More Efficient

With hydroponics, you’re growing your plants in a water-based nutrient solution, but these systems use water more efficiently than any type of traditional farming and irrigation. They use up to 10 times less water than traditional agriculture because the majority of the water is captured and recycled, rather than being allowed to drain into the soil like you would with a regular farm plot or garden.

### 2. Better Use of Space

If you’re planting a standard garden, you’re usually looking at a single-layer of plant life inserted into the soil or in planter beds, depending on your situation. With hydroponics, you aren’t just growing horizontally you can grow vertically, too.

You’ve got the option to plant in connected racks that stretch from floor to ceiling, growing between three to 10 times as many plants in the same space that you’d use for traditional farming.

### 3. Faster Growth

You might be hesitant to start farming or growing a garden because it takes quite a while. You’re looking at months before you’ll have something tasty to enjoy, so why go through all the effort if you can get the same thing at your local grocery store or farmer’s market? With hydroponics, you can enjoy the fruits of your labor between 25-30% faster.

Instead of spending energy creating a root system that reaches for nutrients in the soil, all of the nutrients your plants could need are delivered directly to them, allowing them to spend all of their energy growing leaves and produce.

### 4. Climate Controlled

Growing a garden can be challenging in many parts of the country. Your growing season might be incredibly short, especially if it gets cold early and stays cold for a long time. You might not be able to break into the frozen ground until well after the spring growing season is supposed to start.

Thankfully, with hydroponics which is usually done indoors or in a climate-controlled environment growing seasons are a thing of the past. If you want to grow strawberries in the dead of winter, you’re more than welcome to do so as long as you’ve got the correct nutrient solution.

### 5. No Need for Pest Control

Traditional farming is done outside, which means you have to contend with all the bugs and pests that live there to grow your crops. While there are some challenges that are unique to hydroponics, for the most part, you won’t have to worry about pest control because you’ll be leaving all the pests outside.

This also means you get to enjoy organic produce without worrying about what might have been sprayed on it or where it’s coming from, providing you with a healthier choice.

### 6. Job Growth

Much of the agricultural industry is worried because automation could potentially replace upwards of 60% of the jobs in the sector. Whether you work in the industry or are concerned about its future, hydroponics is a smart investment. Hydroponics and related jobs are some of the fastest-growing stem careers in the country, and that will continue into the future as more farms, both public and private, start to adopt this technology.

## Final Thoughts

There are downsides to Hydroponics, just like any other thing in life. But you can overcome most of them with just some planning and experiences. Considering the pros it can offer, Hydroponics is worth doing. Meanwhile, Hydroponics has great potential.

  
The market for Hydroponics is expected to expand dramatically in the coming years. It is valued at USD 23.94 billion (2018) and is forecast to account for a [CAGR](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cagr.asp) of 6.8% from 2019 - 2024. So if you are already interested in Hydroponics, go create one now. You'll enjoy it and you won’t regret it.
