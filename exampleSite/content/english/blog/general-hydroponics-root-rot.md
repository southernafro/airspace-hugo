Are you looking to find out more about general hydroponics root rot? Whilst hydroponic growing is advantageous in a lot of ways, it also has its pitfalls, and things that you need to be careful of. Root rot is one of those downsides. It is not uncommon in all forms of plant growth, regardless of the type of planting that you do, hydroponics included.

It usually goes unnoticed and as such may do a lot more damage to the plant before it can be fixed or before the plant is beyond repair. One of the reasons why it usually goes unnoticed is because it is usually “misdiagnosed”. Often, problems associated with root rot are mistaken as something else and hence never given the care and attention they deserve to avoid the destruction of the plant.

## How can you tell root rot?

Whilst root rot is often mistaken as something else, there are telltale signs that will make it easy for you to know that your plants roots are being attacked. With the roots being attacked it means there isn’t much room for healthy growth. The plant may begin to wilt, or perhaps have some signs of nutrient burn. That’s if there is still a slither of hope. Sometimes, your plants may just totally die.

The thing about root rot is that it manifests in different ways and so it is not always easy to pick it out if a lineup is the prime suspect. This could be because root rot can affect a lot of plants at the same time. The way a plant rots is also depends on how it flowers and blooms. Some plant leaves will curl inward-facing up or down.

One of the easiest ways to tell if root rot, especially in deep water culture hydroponic systems, is to lift the lid and smell the water. When root rot takes place, there may be a smell emanating from the tank which is difficult to miss. Also, you can take a close look at the roots. A slight tint may not be much to worry about. But if the roots are slimy and smell, it could be a clear sign that the plant has root rot.

## Causes of root rot.

At this stage, you may be asking what causes root rot in hydroponics. Knowing the causes also helps you know how to prevent it from happening. One of the leading causes of root rot is the lack of oxygen. If your plant roots are not getting enough oxygen, this can cause the roots to start rotting.

In hydroponic farming, there can be instances where the roots are submerged in water entirely, and this is in deep water culture. This is one of the instances when root rot is more likely to occur. Extended exposure to water can cause the roots to rot.

## How can I treat root rot in a hydroponic system?

There isn’t too much of a difference between treating and preventing root rot. One of the things that you can do is to immediately discard the different parts of the plant that are dead. You can also clean the plant roots physically to see how badly rotten the roots are and take care of those that still have a fighting chance.

You will also do well to create a cool environment in the reservoir. Bacteria multiply in warm environments. So keeping it cool will reduce the chances of the roots rotting. This also means that you should keep the nutrient solution cool rather than warm. Whilst these aren’t the only ways to treat root rot, they do a good job of it.
