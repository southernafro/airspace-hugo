The world has developed a lot in the 21st century; however, all this development comes at the expense of the environment. We have seen a lot of unexplainable and rare weather conditions on both sides of the hemisphere. One would have noticed by now that the average daily temperature has significantly increased, this is all because of the greenhouse effect. How does the greenhouse effect raise the temperatures so high? Imagine a greenhouse with glass walls and a glass roof; such a structure stays warm inside, even during the winter.

During the day, sunlight shines into the greenhouse and warms up all of the air inside the greenhouse. During the night, it's colder outside, but the greenhouse stays warm inside. This is because the glass walls of the greenhouse trap the sun’s heat but do not release the warm air.

The greenhouse effect works the same way on earth. Gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, trap heat just like a glass greenhouse. These heat-trapping gases are called greenhouse gases. To solve this issue of greenhouse gasses or at least reduce them, well earth is just like a greenhouse because it has a lot of plants both on land and in water. To reduce the greenhouse gases on earth, first of all, we have to reduce or stop the number of fossil fuels we burn; then lastly we have to plant as many trees as we can because green plants use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis then give us oxygen.

## **GREENHOUSE GARDENING**

Greenhouses can help increase plant growth, fruit production and allow you to grow plants that wouldn’t normally survive or those that are out of season. To get the most out of your greenhouse, you just have to understand how the process works. Plants need light, warm temperatures, air, water, and nutrients to survive and give the best yield. Different species of plants need these necessities in different proportions. A greenhouse will make sure your plants get sunlight and heat, but the other necessities have to be provided by you.

## **How Greenhouses work:**

They are mostly made of translucent material like glass or plastic; this is to allow the much-needed sunlight to reach the plants.

When the light comes in through the glass walls of the greenhouse, the plants take the light they need then the rest is absorbed by the ground as heat, black surfaces absorb more of this heat so much cooler areas ought to have darker greenhouse grounds to absorb the heat need. Once the light becomes heat, it can no longer easily escape as it got in because most greenhouses are airtight. The trapped heat then warms the air inside the greenhouse.

Sometimes the sun may be too hot making the temperature in the greenhouse much higher than outside; this is very dangerous because the greenhouse can get hot enough to cook the plants inside with the water vapour. To prevent this on sweltering summer days, the greenhouse needs to be ventilated during the day to keep the temperatures not so high. On days when there is no sunlight, the greenhouse may heat up very slowly or not heat up at all, in such cases, then one needs to use artificial heating. For this reason, using a greenhouse is less costly in areas that receive a lot of sunlight.

## **How to utilize your greenhouse in different seasons:**

### **Spring**

– start seeds in trays inside the greenhouse. As the seedlings emerge, transplant them into large pots and keep them in the greenhouse until all danger of frost has passed, after that then you can take your plants to the fields if you wish.

### **Summer**

– this is the season to start fall flowers, perennials and other plants inside the greenhouse.

### **Fall**

– this is a great time to start holiday plants like amaryllis bulbs inside the greenhouse. With the right knowledge, you can also force Christmas cactus to bloom. Even those house plants that can’t fit on sunny window sills can be put in the greenhouse during this period.

### **Winter**

– cold-hardy vegetables like lettuce are best in the greenhouse at this time. Protect tender herbs and annuals you want to save, such as geraniums, by growing them in the greenhouse throughout the winter.

## **Heating and cooling**

The ideal temperature in the greenhouse is between 25 to 30 degrees Celsius; one needs to be familiar with how to maintain this temperature range. Greenhouses mainly harness the sun’s rays to heat the interior air; some have supplemental heat sources powered by gas or electricity. On a scorching summer day, the interior of the greenhouse can heat up to over 38 degrees Celsius, so there is a great need to regulate the temperature as these incredibly high temperatures can be harmful to the plants.

For this reason, all greenhouses should have vents and fans that whisk out hot air and usher in cooler air; you can choose to use vents that operate manually or automatically. Manual systems are cheaper, but you must remember to open and shut the vents or prop open the door during the day and close it at night.

For those who don’t have the time or aren’t at home most of the time, the automatic system is what you are looking for, though this will cost a whole lot more. Automatic ventilation systems work on a sensor that kicks on the fans or heating if the temperature rises or falls below the threshold that you would have programmed into the system, similar to how most of the home heating and cooling systems work.

## **Challenges**

From what has been discussed it seems greenhouses are a haven for plants, but greenhouses do have some shortcomings. Greenhouses do allow gardeners to extend the growing season; it also means natural insect predators are reduced. This means if you get an insect infestation inside the greenhouse, you’re also offering the bad bugs the perfect shelter with a ready source of food. Moulds, fungi and viruses love the warm, humid conditions inside the greenhouse. To curb these from damaging your plants, one should check their greenhouse very often and isolate affected plants right away to treat them before the problem spreads.
