Are you looking for new ways to grow your plants that do not need soil for you to grow plants? Hydroponics is an effective way to do this. There are different hydroponic systems that you can take advantage of. An NFT hydroponic system is one of those. In this article, we take a look at how to build an NFT hydroponic system. Let's take a look, shall we?

## How does an NFT system work?

Hydroponics allows you to grow plants indoors, and avoid the hassle of soil everywhere. Itâ€™s a cleaner job. However, it needs a certain set of skills and know-how. An NFT hydroponic system is a nutrient film technique, which takes nutrients from a reservoir, after which it disperses them through a channel and out to all the growing plants. It's an efficient way to get all the plants fed with the necessary nutrients.

When the nutrient water has been passed through the plants, it is returned to the reservoir, which is a great way to ensure that no resource is wasted. It also means that there are no harmful chemicals that will make it into the air and in the environment, as can be the case with other agricultural methods.

## What materials will you need to build an NFT system?

There are a couple of things that you will need to build your nutrient film technique hydroponic system. You will need a PVC pipe 4inches wide. You will also need a grow light. There are many different types of grow lights, you can take your pick of those that would best suit your growing needs.

You will also need to get two pieces of two by fours and six feet of three-quarter-inch wide vinyl tubing. These need to be in two different pieces, one needs to be ten inches whilst the other four feet six inches. You will also need a storage bin, three-inch plastic netted pots, and a 159gph submersible pump.

Then you will need liquid hydroponic nutrients, which is what will feed the plants. A growing medium will also be needed to support the plants. These can range from pine shavings, coconut coir, perlite, or clay pebbles amongst many other growing medium options. Then you will need two five-inch PVC flat caps.

You will also need tools to work with which should include a three-quarter inch drill bit, a three-inch drill bit, a one-inch drill bit, and of course a drill.

## How to build the system.

You will first need to build the channel, then build the reservoir, then put them together. To build the channel, first, cut it to a size that will fit on top of the storage bin, then cut three-inch equidistant holes, which will hold the channel pots. On the other end of the holes, drill a 3/8inch hole, this is how water will be drained.

Then drill a second 3/8inch hole adjacent to the middle of one of the PVC caps. Then use the two pieces of wood to cut a trapezoid in it, and create a wedge of some sort, that will then hold the channel in place.

To make the reservoir, drill a 3/8inch hole in the middle far end of the storage bin. Using a ten-inch black vinyl tubing, you can now connect this hole, with one on the opposite end. Then drill a 1-inch hole to accommodate the power plug and to pump water into the channel.

Now push the 4foot 6inch tube into the hole that is closest to the outlet hole. Then put the 10-inch tube through the hole at the end. Now you can connect the pump, by putting it into the bin, and connecting the longer tube to it. Then put the two wooden wedges on either side of the lid, so that you can balance the channel.

You can then connect the 10inch tube to the bottom of the channel, then put the long tube in the end cap. You will need to ensure that the roots are not entirely submerged in water, causing them to drown. Now you can add the nutrient mix.
