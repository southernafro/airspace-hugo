Are you looking for the best way to clean air stones? These little devices are at home in a water body. They are added to a fish tank or aquarium and sometimes used in hydroponics, to ensure that there is enough oxygen circulating. This means that there is a high chance that the stones will get algae and become dirty as they spend more time in the water.

In this article, we take a look at how best to clean air stones. Some of these ways include refreshing the tank often enough, washing the stones, soaking them in bleach solutions, and also other ways that we will get into. Let's take a look, shall we?

## How can I clean air stones safely?

Using fresh clean water, rinse the air stones, and remove any dirt that may be stuck to them. You can use a brush to help get rid of anything with a stubborn streak. You could stop at this stage, but it will only remove dirt visible and certainly not bacteria. Once this is done, you can air dry them. Make sure that they are completely dry. After this, boil the stones for about ten minutes. take them out and let them air dry.

Once again, when they are dry, soak them in a cleaning solution such as one part bleach and three parts clean water. keep it in this solution for about twenty-four hours. The number of hours that you soak the stones for, will depend on how dirty it was. After this stage, you can now let it air dry. Make sure it is completely dry before you put it away or reuse it.

You could also soak the stones in water, and add denture tablets. Keep the stones in this solution at least overnight. This should give the tablets enough time to dig through all the nooks and crannies and get out all the muck. When you are done, clean the stones out, the next day, with clean water, and then air dry.

Another method that you can use is to soak in a solution of vinegar and water. This solution can help clean the air stones especially if they have calcium build-up. It does this by breaking down build-up that may be on the stones.

For hydroponics stones, you can use hydrogen peroxide to clean the stones. First wash the stones, dry them, and place them in a container that the stones can fit in. pour in the hydrogen peroxide to cover the stones. Soak them overnight, and then remove them the next day. Make sure to rinse the stones thoroughly using freshwater and then air dry them. The point is to make sure that there is no hydrogen peroxide leftover on the stones.

## What not to do

Always avoid drying them or using a heat source such as a microwave or an oven. This is because air stones have plastic couplings in them. Placing them in an oven would just melt parts of it.

## One last thing

Air stones are necessary components in water tanks. They are often used in aquariums, composts, and hydroponics. They are how oxygen is reintroduced in water or moist surfaces helping living organisms to breathe better. It's important to keep the stones clean so that they do their job. They will usually begin to lose effectiveness about five weeks into use depending on their structure.

We hope that this helps you clean your stones for a less price. Ultimately, you must prioritize keeping the living organisms happy and alive. This includes having an air stone that will be effective enough.
