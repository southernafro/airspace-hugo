Are you wondering how to start hydroponic farming? It is one of the best ways to grow plants, without using too much space. This advantage means that you can still grow plants even if you live in the city. Starting a hydroponic farm is not too difficult, depending on the scale that you will be doing it on.

For large scale farming, write down your business plan, and make sure that your costs do not outweigh your profit. For small scale hydroponic farming, you will need a few tools that you probably already have around the house, like a bucket, a garden house, and water.

The other things that you will need are a pH-testing kit with buffer solutions, planting cups, twine, plant clips, a 50gallon nutrient tank, PVC pipe, plastic tubes, a pump, fertilizer made just fo for hydroponic systems, water and plants, expanded clay cables, a stand, and a PVC trellis

The first thing that you want to do is to establish where you will be doing your farming. The entire system needs to be in a closed room, with a level floor. This is so that all the plants get an equal amount of water and nutrients. If you want to use the system outside, you must protect it from the sun.

The growing tubes need to be made of 6 inch PVC. The tank is placed under the table, and this is where the nutrients and water come from. It is transported using the pump which sits inside the tank. The water and the nutrients are transported through PVC pipes. Each of the tubes has drainpipes that lea back to the tank, making sure that a perfect cycle of nutrients is created and nothing goes to waste.

The next thing that you need to do, mixes the nutrients in the water. This is where you will now need to use the tank and the fertilizer recommended for the plants that you want to grow. Fill the tank with water, then add the fertilizer as directed. When you have done this, you can turn the pump on and allow the system to circulate for at least thirty minutes, to make sure that it is properly mixed.

Once you have done this, you can now place the plants in the tubes so that they can start to grow in the system. If you will be transplanting plants from the soil, then it is important to make sure that you remove all the soil from the roots before you place them in the growing tubes. The reason for this is to make sure that there is no soil to clog the spray holes.

Once you have done this, pull as much of the roots as is possible, through the holes in the bottom of the plant cup. Now you can add the expanded clay pebbles which are what help hold the plant down. The next thing to do is tie the plants to the trellis and watch the plants grow. Make sure that you tun the pump on daily and watch your plants flourish!
