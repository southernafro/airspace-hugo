Most if not all of us our ancestors ate what they grew and caught, this affinity to grow our own food for most of us is still there but we have a lot of limitations. One of the biggest limitations is the shortage of space to set up that garden since most of the people nowadays live in high rise buildings where one can have an apartment on the 10th floor without access to any land, the answer to these problems and many to be discussed is hydroponics.

Hydroponics lets you have a garden even on the balcony or on the top of your roof, it is a type of farming called hydroculture that does not need soil to cultivate plants. Today we are not concentrating on hydroponics itself but on what Kenya has done in hydroponics. Hydroponics Kenya started in the year 2012 and they are one of the pioneers of this practice in Kenya, they have not only limited themselves to Kenya, but they have also installed hydroponics systems in countries like Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania.

## **Growing plants**

The global population is estimated to grow to about 10 billion in the year 2050. With such a large population it’s obvious there will be a serious straight on food security. Hydroponics is one of those initiatives that will reduce the food deficit by allowing everyone to grow a bit of the food they consume and not wait for commercial farmers.

On the side of the commercial farmer, it will definitely boost the profit they make because on the same amount of land they can plant twice as many crops, use more than 70% less water, make them immune to some unpleasant weather conditions like dry spells, make it easier to control pests and diseases which thrive in soil and make weeding a thing of the past.

Hydroponics is used mostly to grow vegetables but more research is being done on more crops, the vegetables that do best are kales and spinach. The vegetables currently being cultivated through hydroponics in Kenya include peas, cucumbers, eggplants, cabbages, broccoli, celery, onion, basil, mint, tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, strawberries, peppers, chillies, squash, melons, carrot, beetroot, garlic and coriander. Most first-timers start with lettuce since it has a short maturity time and can easily be cultivated all year long without much-sophisticated temperature control.

## **Hydroponics types in Kenya**

1. Drip system – this is among the best systems and it is no surprise that it is the most common in Kenya. The system is relatively easy and inexpensive due to the relative availability of the equipment needed. In this system, vital nutrients are added to the tank of water which is kept separate to the plants. The water is then pumped up a network of tubes, and released to the plants individually. The pump can be controlled by a timer, taking manual watering out of the equation, and allowing you to decide how frequent you want your water cycles to occur. You can also ration how much water each plant gets using an emitter. This means you can put a variety of plants into the same system and tailor-make watering cycles to cater to different plants’ individual needs. There are two types of drip systems, the recovery system and the non-recovery drip system. In a hydroponic recovery system, any excess nutrient solution will drain back into the nutrient reservoir and can be reused making it more efficient as no water is lost. In a non-recovery system, the opposite is true.
2. Flood and Drain System – also called the ebb and flow system, this is the second most popular system. They work in a similar way as the drip system.
3. Nutrient film technique – this technique is mostly used in commercial hydroponics, particularly for short harvest crops
4. Aeroponics system – this is the most advanced system of all the hydroponics systems. The technology is so advanced that it is expected to end food shortages, the reason why it is expected to end food shortage is that it offers the possibility of a group of plants to be grown vertically meaning less land is required to farm.
5. Deep Water culture – these are considered the simplest method of hydroponics.
6. Aquaponics – this is interlinked farming of both fish and vegetables that gives the farmer benefits of both the plants and fish.

Mr Peter Chenge with his expertise in the hydroponics industry has aided in the setting up of a lot of prominent systems. He continues with his noble cause but is not only confined to hydroponics as he is also sharing knowledge in rearing pigs in some parts of Kenya. He is scheduled to stay in Kenya for the next two years.
