Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture that is used as a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions found in water, without soil. It’s a great method as terrestrial plants may be grown. Studies have shown that plants grow better with their roots in water than in soil.

Water that is used in the process of hydroponic farming remains in the system. It can be reused and so the need for fresh water supply is significantly reduced. Besides that, the idea of growing one’s own food in Kerala is by no means new to them. They are already known to grow plants such as rice, paddy, tomatoes and many more

## Techniques and Nutrient Solutions

In Kerala, they make us of two Hydroponic cultures depending on which plant they are working with. They make use of solution culture and medium culture. Both which require slightly different methods and both which yield slightly different results.

### Solution Culture

Solution culture is a technique in which no solid medium for roots is required. Only the nutrients are important. The three main types of solution cultures are static solution culture, continuous-flow solution culture and aeroponics.

#### Static Solution Culture (SSC)

With SSC plants are grown in containers of nutrient solution, such as glass jars, plastic buckets, tubs, or tanks. The nutrient solution is changed either on a schedule, such as once per week, or when the concentration drops below a certain level.

#### Continuous Flow Culture (cfc)

When using the CFC, the nutrient solution constantly flows past the roots. Unlike the SSC, with CFC sampling and changes and adjustments to the temperature and nutrient concentrations can be made in a large storage tank that serves plants. Unlike dealing with a single pod at a time.

#### Aeroponics

This method requires no substrate and entails growing plants with their roots suspended in a deep air or growth chamber with the roots periodically wetted with a fine mist of atomized nutrients.

### Medium Culture and Methods

There is much to say with Medium Culture. When it comes to the medium culture this requires a solid medium for the roots and is named after the type of medium that is used. For example, it could be sand culture, gravel culture or Rockwool culture.

Passive sub-irrigation—is the simplest method wherein plants are grown in an inert porous medium that transports water and fertilizer to the roots by capillary action.

Ebb and flow—In its simplest form, there will be a tray filled with the medium above a reservoir of nutrient solution.

Run to waste—with this form, the nutrient and water solution is periodically applied to the medium surface.

Deepwater culture— here plant production is done by means of suspending the plant roots in a solution of nutrient-rich, oxygenated water.

Bubbleponics—this is the art of delivering a highly oxygenated nutrient solution direct to the root zone of plants.

Fogponics— this is an advanced form of aeroponics which uses water in a vaporised form to transfer nutrients and oxygen to enclosed suspended plant roots.

## Conclusion

In Kerala, Hydroponics is quite popular and has been known to be the most common form of farming there. Pest problems have been reduced and they can fully grow their plants in their homes without much to worry about or lose.
