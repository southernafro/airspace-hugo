title = "HYDROPONIC FARMING IN NEPAL"
type = "post"

+++
Hydroponics is a type of hydroculture, which means growing something with mineral solutions in a water solvent without using soil. Hydroponics has recently been introduced in Nepal and could be a promising farming method. Nepal has given a lot of attention to this system because of the growing agricultural demands. This brings us to the company “[Hydroponics Nepal](https://hydroponicsnepal.com/).” They are the pioneer initiator and leader of hydroponic system development in Nepal. Their goal is to enable farmers to grow predictable and highly nutritious vegetables at a limited cost of input. With hydroponic farming, the farmer is not affected by the years' seasons and adverse weather conditions.

## Hydroponic System

In Nepal, you can purchase complete hydroponic vegetable systems to suit your individual needs or for the community in which you stay. Vegetables that are grown hydroponically are usually healthier than soil-grown vegetables. They receive a balanced diet of nutrients in a water solution and are free from soil-borne pests and diseases. The systems conserve water and nutrients by preventing evaporation and runoff. If you plan to build a small system on the rooftop of your house in Nepal, the area required to set up your hydroponic garden is as small as 1 meter squared.

In arid regions where water is scarce, one can grow a wide spectrum of plants using hydroponic technology. Since the systems deliver water and nutrients directly to the plants, you can place the vegetables closer together without the stress of starving them. Healthier plants contribute to higher yields. By growing plants in a clean environment, under the ‘perfect’ conditions, hydroponic systems save the cost of preparing the soil, using insecticides, fungicides, and losses due to drought or ground flooding in some cases.

In Nepal’s most urbanized city, [Kathmandu Agriculture-Engineering](https://www.facebook.com/Nepalese-Society-of-Agricultural-Engineers-219526304764207/) Plus Pvt. Ltd was founded with the core mission of bringing innovation to agriculture through the use of sustainable technology. They encourage people to produce organic vegetables in their own homes. The Nepal government has predicted its population to grow to 9 billion people in 2050. It’s not hard to notice the pressure that has been put on the environment, affecting the access to and the production of natural resources.

They have farmed, dammed, and mined the most lucrative and easily accessible areas in the past, leaving little alternative other than to expand onto marginal lands to sustain the population's food needs. Agribusinesses and corporations see the food industry in terms of economic efficiency when they focus on environmental equality, which is where hydroponics comes into play. Small-scale farms have the power to reshape the food system more sustainably.

Hydroponics is not just farming. It’s science. In hydroponics, you have to monitor your levels, making sure to keep them at an optimum level for whatever crop you will be growing. Most of those already in hydroponics farming grow lettuce. This is because it is easy to take care of and matures in a short time of between 30-85 days. Other plants like tomatoes are more difficult to grow and require a more sophisticated approach. This is mainly because they need to be pollinated.

With the rapid urbanization of Kathmandu and land getting increasingly scarce and expensive, hydroponics could not have come at a better time. It may seem expensive to set up a hydroponics garden, but it saves a great deal in the long run. To install the system over 400 square feet of land, Rs 50 000 – 75 000 has to be spent on: pump, timer, submersible pump, high-tech tunnel, containers, and nutrients. You can set up smaller systems with as little investment as Rs20 000. In Nepal, a knowledgeable technician will cost you Rs 1 500 a day to set up your own hydroponics system.

## Advantages of hydroponics

* Plants do not contract soil-borne diseases since there is no soil involved.
* Less time spent in nurturing plants by cutting on processes like weeding
* Plants do not have to compete for nutrients. Hence they are healthier having enough nutrients.

## Disadvantages of hydroponics

* Require continuous power supply for the water to run continuously
* The chemicals used are only 80% organic
* The plants need to be controlled lighting and temperature

## What has the government done

The Nepal government has not yet started doing hydroponic farming itself. Still, it supports the farmers that are already practicing it, one of the ways of supporting is lifting of tax on all nutrients for hydroponics since these nutrients have to be imported to Nepal; however, hydroponics farmers in Nepal continue to ask for loans to be availed to them by the government to let them reach their greatest potentials. The government continues to urge farmers to take up hydroponics in conjunction with aquaponics, aquaponics, and vegetables and fish farming concurrently.
