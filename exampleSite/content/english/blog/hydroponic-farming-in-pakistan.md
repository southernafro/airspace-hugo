Pakistan is fast closing in on per capita of water availability which is less than 1000 cubic meters. This indicates that the country is already water-scarce and will be bone-dry by the year 2025. The agriculture sector plays a big role in the economy as it contributes to about 19% of the gross domestic product and absorbs about 42% of the labour force. Food imports caused a capital increase of $6.2 billion dollars in the fiscal year of 2017 to 2018. So the people and some farmers in Pakistan moved to Hydroponic farming to try and control the water situation and capital affair.

“Hydroponic Pakistan” is one of a kind farm that is a proud, cutting-edge hydroponic systems consultancy that encourages us to farm in an efficient manner. Their sole concern is to ensure that they save on water supply while delivering pesticide-free produce available all year round. Hydroponic Farming in Pakistan eradicates the need for pesticides and herbicides while reducing the water consumption compared to conventional farming soil-based methods. Hydroponic Farming is the system of the future that allows for space to be customized and also increases the crop yield using efficient water solutions in a controlled climate environment, much like a greenhouse.

In 2006 a once-booming polyester and filament yarn factory closed down due to a worldwide recession. Sohail Ahmed, the owner of the factory converted the top floor of his old yarn factory into a hydroponic farm twelve years later. He is a proud farmer of Kale, Rosemary and many other vegetables. He now supplies some of the City’s finest restaurants and supermarkets.

## **HYDROPONIC SYSTEM**

This is a system of growing crops without soil. In the hydroponic system, the plant roots grow in a liquid nutrient solution which is a mixture of essential plant nutrients in the liquid.

Hydroponic Systems are the future farming methods considering the space customizations at urban farms. It increases the crop yield with efficient solutions in a controlled environment.

There are six basic Hydroponic Farming Systems

1. Wick

This is the simplest hydroponic system. It is a passive system with no moving parts. The nutrient solution is drawn into the growing medium from the reservoir or tank with a wick. This system uses a variety of growing mediums such as; Perlite, Vermiculite, Pro-Mix and Coconut Fiber.

2. Water Culture

This system is made of Styrofoam and floats directly on the nutrient solution. It uses an air pump that supplies the air to the air stone that bubbles the nutrient solution and supplies oxygen to the roots. Water Culture is the ideal system for growing leaf lettuce which is fast-growing and water-loving plants.

3. Ebb and Flow (Flood and Drain)

The Flood and Drain system work by temporarily flooding the grow tray with nutrient solution and then draining it back to the tank or reservoir. This is done using a submerged pump on a timer.

4. Drip (recovery or nob-recovery)

Drip System is the most widely used type of Hydroponic Systems in the world. The operation is a simple timer controlled pump that pumps the nutrient solution onto the base of each plant using a small drip line.

5. Nutrient Film Technique (N.F.T)

N.F.T systems have a constant nutrient solution flow with no timer required for the submersible pump. The nutrient solution is pumped to the growing tray or tube and flows over the roots of the plants and then drains back into the tank or reservoir.

6. Aeroponic

Aeroponic systems are high tech. The roots hang in the air and are misted with the nutrient solution every few minutes. Because the roots are exposed to the air, they will rapidly dry out if the misting cycles are interrupted.

When growing plants using hydroponic farming in Pakistan, it provides 90% water saving compared to conventional farming, because the water can be reused within the system, reducing the constant need for freshwater. It saves 80% of space for farming in soil. Nutrient delivery of the system is controlled and completely natural. You can grow indoors all year round using a small amount of energy and chemicals. The chemistry of water and purity of nutrients is controlled. Hydroponic Farming is eco-friendly with a guarantee of all year round leafy greens. Plants have a 50% faster growth rate than they would in soil-based farms.

Pakistan’s agricultural development suffers because of an arid/ semi-arid environment. They have drastic climate challenges, water availability is scarce and the quality of natural resources are not so great. I believe this is why they have decided to take the Hydroponic Farming route, and well let’s be realistic here, why wouldn’t they want to improve their crop yield and save on water. As should the rest of the world.
