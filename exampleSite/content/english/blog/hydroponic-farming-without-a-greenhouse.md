Are you wondering whether it is possible to conduct hydroponic farming without a greenhouse? To understand what you need, it helps to know what type of farming you are venturing into. In this article we take a look at hydroponic farming without a greenhouse. Is it possible, what are the pros and cons and what you can look forward to?

## What is hydroponic farming?

First, let us explore what hydroponic farming is. This is a system of growing plants and crops using only water. Eliminating the need to plant in soil, which can come with a plethora of issues such as using up a lot of land and water. A simple definition is growing plants without soil. Hydroponic farming has come about from the realisation that soil is not an essential part of growing plants or crops.

## What types of hydroponic farming are there?

There are different types of hydroponic farming, which include a hydroponic drip system, the wick system, nutrient film technique, aeroponic system, raft hydroponic system and ebb and flow which is also called the flood and drain technique. These all use different mechanisms, but the one thing that they have in common, they all have no need for soil and they are all water based farming systems.

## What is the role of a greenhouse in hydroponic farming?

A green house is designed to keep the plants covered and protected from the harsh elements of nature. It is a way of creating a controlled environment. It also enables you to grow a variety of plants in the same space, and consistently as well. You do not have to rely on the weather pattern to grow your plants. This means that you have an all season garden.

The controlled environment is great for maximum photosynthesis. It also makes the most of the energy and contributes to increased yields. A green house will also help reduce the amount of water that you use, because there is less water that evaporates. It also aids in saving up on your space and shortens crop cycles as well.

These are all the things that are great about using a greenhouse for hydroponic farming, but now the question stands, is it possible to grow plants hydroponically without a greenhouse? This means that you will need to forgo the benefits of having a controlled environment.

A green house will also protect your plants from evaporation. When they are out in the open, this will happen a lot and you may need to use hydro gels to protect them. A green house on the other hand will be all the protection that your plants need.

## Advantages of outdoor hydroponics

It is common thinking that hydroponic farming has to be done in a greenhouse. It is possible to grow plants hydroponically outdoors, but at the same time it has its downsides. Outdoor hydroponic farming is great for getting in some natural light for the plants, but it also means that your plants are exposed to the sun and more water evaporates from them faster, than when they are in a greenhouse.

Whilst the greenhouse will be equipped with grow lights, they are not able to replicate the exact benefits that plants will get from the sun. The sun is a great source of natural light and it is also very easy on the pocket, it is free!

## Disadvantages of outdoor hydroponics.

Growing your plants outside of the greenhouse allows them to be grown under natural conditions which can be very good for the plants. Growing them outside has disadvantages such as the changing weather conditions and the amount of sunlight that the plants will get. You will not be able to control natural conditions.

Also, plants that are grown outside will not have the same protection that plants grown in a greenhouse will have. This can cause the plants to die or wilt. Also, when you grow the plants outside, you are relying on the seasons and the weather conditions that they bring about. The season will dictate what you can grow and what you cannot.

You will also need to pay special attention to the nutrient mixture and maybe add more. When it rains, the nutrient mixture can get diluted and as a result not be as effective. More nutrients also means more money that needs to be spent on the project, and this could defeat the purpose especially if you are looking for a cost effective way to grow your plants hydroponically.

## One last thing

Is it possible to grow plants hydroponically without a greenhouse? There are various hydroponic farming techniques and these usually thrive in controlled conditions. This is why it is best to grow them in a greenhouse. However this does not mean that it is not possible to grow plants outside of the greenhouse. The downside with a greenhouse is that it can be pricey, this then cuts out the small farmer or the one without a commercial budget.

Whilst growing plants hydroponically may seem like it does not need much, there are certain conditions that need to be met. The more controlled an environment is, the better it will be for the plants. This does not mean that outdoor hydroponics is impossible, we just prefer the greenhouse version that has so much to offer your plants.

We hope that weighing the odds between indoor and outdoor hydroponics, helps you decide whether or not you will need a greenhouse to grow your plants. It is a decision that can make all the difference between a worthy investment, and flushing your inputs down the drain.

The bottom line is that hydroponics can be done outside, only if the necessary precautions are followed and when you follow the advice given about the plants that you will need to be growing. If you are not up to the task of adapting to the variables that outdoor hydroponics brings with it, then this may not be cut out for you. Happy farming!
