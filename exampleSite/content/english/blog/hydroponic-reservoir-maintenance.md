Just ventured into hydroponics? Perhaps you are now wondering about hydroponic reservoir maintenance and all thatâ€™s there to it. In this article, we will look at what you will need to do, in order to make sure that your reservoir is well maintained. We also look at why it is important that you keep it well maintained. Let's dive in, shall we?

## Why should I maintain my hydroponic reservoir?

Keeping a close eye on a water reservoir in a hydroponic system may not be top of your list because quite frankly, it may not seem that much of a big deal. As long as the system is working, you reckon there is no need to fuss. But on the contrary, you need to take care of it. Just like you do not see your heart or other vital organs, but you still need to take care of them, if your body is to keep on functioning well.

To understand why you should keep it clean, you will need to understand what purpose it serves in the first place. A water reservoir in a hydroponic system feeds the entire system. This is where the water and nutrient solution comes from.it needs to be kept clean so that the plants only get the intended nutrients and nothing else. It needs to be sterile. The reservoir can very well be compared to the heart of a hydroponic system.

## How to maintain a hydroponic reservoir

Before you fill it up with water, make sure that you check on the water quality. You can use a TDS/PPM EC meter. In some cases, it becomes necessary to run reverse osmosis or distill the water. The water will need to have a maximum ppm of 50 or up to 100 before you can add nutrients to it. If it's above these levels, extra care has to be taken.

The nutrient solution that you will be using will have a pH balance of its own. Because of this, you will have to check on it daily and note down any changes that may be occurring. To test the nutrients, you will need to run them through the reservoir at least twice. Knowing the pH levels of your nutrients will help you balance them out better. You must keep it between 5.5 and 6.5.

The pH balance can be altered or weakened if it is too strong, by adding more water to it. If it is weak then you can add fertilizer. The solution in the reservoir will need to be changed or topped up when your meter shows that it is at a point that is inadequate for the plants. You can tell this, by using a TDS/PPM meter.

It is also important to remember never to use full nutrients to top up the reservoir. Another important thing that you will need to keep in mind, is to have a nutrient reservoir being the same size as that of the storage bin or empty tub.

The other way in which to maintain your reservoir is to keep a close eye on the nutrient solution temperature. If the temperature is too high, it can cause the roots to rot, and if it's too low, it can slow down the plant's growth. The reservoir needs to have the optimum temperatures so that the common end goal is achieved, which is to have healthy plants.

Also, make sure that the reservoir is properly aerated and the filter is cleaned out regularly. Check to make sure that all the components are working properly so that you avoid malfunctions. A simple thing to do but that also adds to the lifespan of your reservoir, is changing out the water often.
