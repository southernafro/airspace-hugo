One of the most important things to consider especially in farming is the expense. This will give you a clear idea as to whether or not this is a fruitful venture. The amount of money that you put into the project, needs to be recovered and a profit should also be made. These are some of the factors that may have you asking yourself, is hydroponic farming expensive?

Hydroponic farming has a number of advantages. However, the low input cost is not one of them. As much as it is a sustainable farming method, the cost of inputs and setting up the systems is more costly than traditional farming requires. However, over time, it gets cheaper and more cost-effective.

The actual amount that you will need to spend on your hydroponic farm or garden heavily depends on the size of the farm or garden. This dictates whether you will need 1 or 20 buckets or even more. It also depends on the type of hydroponic system that you want to set up and what you are going to use the system for, whether itâ€™s for a hobby project or commercial farming.

You can get hydroponic systems that are under $100. Whilst these are on the more affordable side, they can also produce many plants. This low-cost type of system works well if you are embarking on small scale projects and also if you are just starting out.

The inputs that drive up the initial set up cost of hydroponic systems include the size of the system, the types of plants that you will be growing, and the nutrients that they will need. However what drives the cost down as you go along is eliminating the need for a lot of labor, machinery to till the land, and also using excess water to water the plants. These are all running costs with soil farms, but not with hydroponic farms.

Long story short, hydroponic farming is expensive, but only initially. As you carry on with the project you will begin to see results and make a profit as you useless. You will only need to be spending on the nutrients to feed the plants. The equipment that you need to set up the system is what will knock a bit of a dent in your pocket.

Hydroponic farms are cost-effective when you look at the rate at which you will get a return on your investment. This farming method has a high plant turnover. Some research suggests that you get up to 3 times more harvest when you use hydroponic systems instead of soil. So even though the initial set up is costly, you will quickly make it back and begin to make a profit.

You also save more money on the water that you use on a hydroponic farm. Whilst it may seem like an oxymoron because this is a water-based system, the water is efficiently circulated and taken directly to the plants, nothing is wasted, save for a low percentage lost through evaporation.
