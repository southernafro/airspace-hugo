Hydroponic farming continues to grow in popularity across the world, thanks to the free flow of information. However people still want to know, is hydroponic farming organic. It can be easy to get lost in the tons of information that is available and forget that for a plant to be organic, it has to have been exempt from certain conditions such as the adding on of artificial nutrients.

This type of farming has variations, however, the common denominator is the fact that you grow the plant without any soil. Eliminating the need for soil means that you are also eliminating some of the vital nutrients that are found in the soil. At the same time, these same nutrients can be fed directly to the plant via the water system.

## What is organic farming?

The question of whether or not hydroponic farming is organic has been debated on many platforms. A number of countries do not accept hydroponic farming as being organic, including the United States. Hence plants grown using this system are not marked as organic produce. Organic farming involves growing of crops and plants with nothing that is manufactured. The fertilizers and pesticides used need to be naturally sourced.

This is where the question comes in. For something to be said it is organic and marked as such, it needs to have no additives or chemicals added to it even if they are nutrients fro the plant. For a farmer to be certified as an organic producer, there is a lot of hoops to jump through to ensure that the plants are not exposed to chemicals at any stage of growth.

The other argument against hydroponic farming and whether or not it is organic is the fact that organic farming needs to also give back to the soil, from the plants that grow in it, so when you use only water as is the case with hydroponic farming, you cut out the use for soil and hence do not give back to it in any way.

## Can I turn my hydroponic farm into an organic one?

Yes. The only thing that separates the two, is the presence of artificial nutrients in fertilizers and the water used to nourish the plants. You can therefore easily switch from inorganic hydroponic farming to organic farming, by switching to nutrients and fertilizers that are only naturally sourced. When you do this, and ensure the plants are never exposed to artificial chemicals, your hydroponic farm can become organic.

## Final thoughts

However, it is possible to have hydroponic plants that are not organic. And so it is important to make sure that you check properly before you buy a product. What influences this, is the nutrients that are fed to the plant. Look for hydroponic organic plants. This way you know what you are getting.

Some say that plants grown hydroponically are not as tasty as those grown in the soil. This is not a scientific fact though and the choice is left to you art the end of the day. Hydroponic plants CAN be organic, but it is not always the case.
