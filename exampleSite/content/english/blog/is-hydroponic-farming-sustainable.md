Is hydroponic farming sustainable? You may be considering changing your farming method, or maybe you are just starting and you are looking for the best way to grow plants in a sustainable manner. This is a key feature so that you make sure that you can keep the farm going. There are several reasons why hydroponic farming is considered sustainable. In this article, we take a look at these.

## What makes hydroponic farming sustainable?

There are a number of factors that have made this age-old type of farming stand the test of time. For starters, regardless of the type of hydroponic system you use, the amount of water used is considerably lower than what you would use if you were to be planted on soil. Some research says hydroponic farming uses 90% less water, this makes it more sustainable.

The second factor that makes this type of farming sustainable, is the kindness that it has on the environment, there are less soil degradation and erosion, which helps sustain the area. You also use a lot less land meaning that you will not need to cultivate the land, taking it away from other elements of nature such as wildlife, which is also sustained by what the land yields.

Also, hydroponic farming is sustainable because it gives you more yields than traditional farming. It does this in a lot less time and this is one of the things that makes this type of farming more sustainable. The other factor that makes is a sustainable farming method, is the fact that you can grow any plant anywhere regardless of the climate in the area. It is an adaptable method.

You can also grow your plants hydroponically, on different scales. This makes it easy to have a hydroponic system even in the heart of an urban area. You can grow plants in areas that they would not ordinarily be able to grow in and this is a big advantage that puts this type of farming at the front of the sustainability wagon.

## Final Thoughts

By definition sustainable farming refers to the ability to farm, without compromising the environment or the land. In short, you want to produce without wasting. Hydroponic farming ticks these boxes as it provides you with the ability to grow plants, and yet still be gentle on the environment.

You use less land and less water to grow plants that have just the same, if not more nutritional value. If the whole world resorted to this type of farming, there would be less worry about what the next generations will do in terms of natural resources.

Whilst it is relatively more costly to set up in comparison to soil farming, there is still a lot to be gained from hydroponic farming. It is considered to be highly sustainable and hence a good idea, especially for the ever-growing populations of the world. We hope this helps you decide on whether to take up hydroponic farming or not, considering its sustainability.
