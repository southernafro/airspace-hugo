Hydroponic farming is the process of growing plants without using soil. In the traditional sense of growing plants, the soil is the one major way the plants get the nutrients they need to grow, along with the sun and water. With Hydroponics, the nutrients are directly fed to the plants instead of being absorbed by the plants through the soil. Hydroponic farming is usually enclosed systems, with plants being grown in greenhouses.

## **Five environmental benefits of Hydroponic farming**

1. Less Land Is Needed – When you plant rows upon rows of cabbages or any type of vegetables in soil, you consume a lot of space. This is different when using Hydroponic Farming. Grow Pots can be placed closer together without causing any problems in the growth of the plants. Nutrients are distributed differently in water compared to soil. Commercial Hydroponic Farming tends to use only one-fifth of the land needed for the same amount of plants being cultivated on farmland.
2. Reduced Fossil Fuel Use with Flexible Growing Locations – This is a very good environmental benefit because it helps cut down the use of fuel that we consume on a daily basis to ship food long distances to markets. Hydroponic Farmers have the choice of establishing their greenhouses in locations that are closer to their intended markets or distribution channels.
3. Less Water Is Used – With the many droughts all around the world, water consumption is now something we all think about when wanting to cultivate crops. Hydroponics water is retained for many days and in some cases even weeks because there is less evaporation and it only uses 10% of the water that soil planting would need.
4. Better for The Earth and Soil – with conventional farming soil erosion is one of the many problems that affect our land and environment. Some countries tend to cut down and clear old forests that are part of the Earth’s lively hood to turn large areas into agricultural land. Unlike conventional farming, Hydroponic Greenhouses will not need to cut down old forests.
5. Reduced Pesticides and Herbicides – In conventional farming, we use two kinds of sprays: Pesticides and Herbicides which are used to control pests and unwanted plants, like, weeds. These sprays do a great deal of damage to the environment because when it rains they can be swept away by the rain contaminating ecosystems and can poison other animals. Because Hydroponics does not use soil, we do not need to worry about weeds in the crops and greenhouses can be built or fortified to resist insect pests.

## **The Advantages and Disadvantages of Hydroponic Farming**

### **Advantages**

* No Pests – Plants won’t be completely guarded against insects but hydroponics does reduce the risk of having pesky insects eating away at your crops. Without the use of soil, the crops are easier to keep clean and clear of those annoying insects.
* More Personal Growth Space – Plants are not fighting for root space so they can grow to their maximum potential, within the optimum time frame. This means you can grow more plants in the same amount of space as you would when planting in soil.
* Water Consumption – All Hydroponic systems are based on a closed water system. Once the water is used, it is sent back to a central reservoir for reuse.

While there are many more pros to hydroponics there are a few downfalls that we need to be aware of.

### **Disadvantages**

* Setup Costs – This is probably the biggest disadvantage because whether you are going big or small the setup of the hydroponic system is a bit pricey. You will have to consider all the accessories needed to get it up and running. However, with the faster growth rate, you will be able to make your money back in no time.
* Equipment Failure – If a piece of system fails, your plants can die off within a matter of hours. With no soil, there is no water or nutrient storage for the plants to feed off.
* Energy Demand – This system is a technological field and therefore it relies on energy to provide optimal conditions for the crops.

## **Summary**

Hydroponics differs from conventional farming in many aspects. It is important to take geographic and regulatory conditions into consideration when planning and operating a Hydroponic System. You should also consider shifts in food, land and water supply and energy sources. The methods costs may vary, but global events such as droughts and population growth shift the energy production and changing urban environments are bound to help cement the position of Hydroponics in the future.
