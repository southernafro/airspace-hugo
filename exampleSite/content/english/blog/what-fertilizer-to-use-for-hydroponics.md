You are no longer limited by geographical conditions, now you can grow plants anytime anywhere, using hydroponics. The important thing is to make sure that you have the right tools and techniques. Knowing what your plants will need, water, nutrients, and the growing medium to use.

Flora grows, (2-1-6) is great for plants in their infancy, when they need macronutrients and higher concentrations of potassium. FloraMicro (5-0-1) has a good amount of nitrogen as well as other minerals (NPK ratio of 5-0-1). Plants need these nutrients at all stages in their growth. Then flor bloom is excellent for plants when they are in their flowering stage. Flora bloom adds phosphorus, magnesium as well as sulfur using the ration (0-5-4)
