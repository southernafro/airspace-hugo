+++
Hydroponics is a lot like Aeroponics, both methods don’t use soil to grow plants. The main difference is that, when it comes to hydroponics, water is used as a growing medium. Whereas in aeroponics, no growing medium is used, yes you read right. The roots are kept within an environment that is saturated with a mist or aerosol of nutrient solution. It sounds a lot like stuff from a science fiction movie.

## **Hydroponics**

This is a different type of horticulture but a subset of hydroculture. This is a method of growing plants without soil. This is done using mineral nutrient solutions mixed in with an aqueous solvent. Earthly plants can be grown with their roots exposed to the nutritious liquid. In addition, the roots can be supported by an inert such as perlite, gravel or other substrates. Hydroponics theoretically means working water or stemming from the Latin words "hydro" which means water, the ponos part means labour.

There are two types of hydroponics which are solution culture as well as medium culture. The Solution culture types are usually the continuous flow of solution culture, a nutrient film-based technique. The medium culture type is for solid medium for roots, sub- or top irrigated, and in a container. Deepwater culture, the plant contained in a net pot which is suspended from a lid and the roots suspended in the nutrient solution. During the Second World War, the U.S. army used hydroponics to produce fresh food for the troops that were stationed on the infertile Pacific island. The Plastic revolution from the 1960s, which was protected cultivation made it easier to control the climate as well as provide intensive plant care.

### **Benefits**

\- Roots are exposed to enough supplies of nutrients, oxygen and water.

\- The growth rate is 30-50 per cent faster as compared to soil plants.

\- The extra oxygen in the growing mediums assist to stimulate root growth.

\- Nutrients in the hydroponic system are then mixed with the water and sent straight to the root system. The plant has no need to search in the soil for the nutrients that it needs.

\- The plant needs very little energy to find as well as to break down food. The plant then uses the saved energy to mature faster plus to produce fruit.

\- The plants also have fewer problems with infestations, funguses and disease.

### **Benefits to the environment**

Hydroponic gardening also offers several benefits to our environment.

\- Uses considerably less water unlike soil gardening, that’s because of the reuse of the nutrient solutions.

\- Fewer pesticides are used on hydroponic plants.

\- As hydroponic gardening systems there is no topsoil, therefore topsoil erosion isn't even an issue.

\- If agricultural tendencies continue to erode topsoil as well as wastewater, hydroponics may soon be the next solution.

### **Disadvantages**

\- Flooding plus waterlogging of roots due to the design.

\- Dependence on the reliability of electricity and water supplies.

\- Operator has to pay close attention to the nutrient balance that is water temperature as well as pathogens.

## **What you need**

For garden units, you shall need the following

\- A source of very clean water

\- Location is very important

\- Specially formulated fertilizer for the plants

\- A timetable so as to attend to the system daily

\- Roughly a little knowledge of what gardening is as well as plants

\- A home unit or even a commercial on will work

As for commercial that is growing on a larger scale:

\- The most important item to get is water. The water has to be of the right quality, quantity as well as reliability.

\- Another key factor is the market, you definitely need one

\- Labour has to be readily available especially during peak season

\- Management skills

\- Experience in crop production and disease management

\- Location

\- Financing

\- Specially formulated, soluble nutrients must always be used.

\- Pests and diseases remain a big risk.

## **Aeroponics**

This is a good alternative for producing plants within small spaces like indoors. Feeding for aeroponics is an easy task, as the plants require fewer nutrients and water most of the time. Besides the fact that the system used indoors, this method requires little space. This method of growing plants is better suited for urban dwellers amongst others.

Generally, aeroponic plants are usually inserted on the top over a reservoir inside some type of sealed container. Feeding for these plants is down through the use of a pump plus a sprinkler system. The sprinkler system periodically sprays a nutrient-rich solution straight onto the plant’s roots. The major drawback of growing plants using the aeroponics way is that you have to keep everything thoroughly clean. The moist environment is continually more susceptible to bacteria growth.

### **Benefits**

\- Fast plant growth means that the plants grow fast as their roots have access to a large supply of oxygen 24/7.

\- Easy system maintenance, all you need to maintain the root chamber is regular disinfecting, and periodically that is the reservoir plus the irrigation channels.

\- The plants need fewer nutrients as well as water on an average, the reason being the nutrient immersion rate is higher. Plants usually retort to aeroponic systems by producing even more roots.

\- The Plants can be moved around without much effort, all that is required is to move the plants from one collar to another.

\- You don’t need a lot of space to start an aeroponic garden. It also depends on the system. If the plants can be stacked up one on top of the other the better.

### **Disadvantages**

\- Dependence on the system, the system is made up of high-pressure pumps, sprinklers as well as timers. If any of these stop working, your plants are at a risk.

\- Technical knowledge is required. You really need a certain level of competency when it comes to running an aeroponic system. The knowledge of nutrients amounts is required by your plant and it is very essential.

\- The root chamber should never be contaminated otherwise diseases may strike the roots. Hydrogen peroxide is used by most so as to disinfect.

\- High-cost nothing comes cheap when it comes to aeroponics systems.

## **Conclusion**

In conclusion, according to what I have learnt, the difference between these two farming methods is the type of water you use for growth. While you need water in its solid form to grow your crops, the hydroponic mist is the go-to guy when it comes to aeroponic. Both methods need funding but in the case of aeroponic, it’s quite pricey. Either way, both methods are good for the environment or explore them more soon.
