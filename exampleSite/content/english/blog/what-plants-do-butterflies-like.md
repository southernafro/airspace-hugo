Butterflies are not only beautiful creatures, they do a great deal for the environment as well. Like bees, they are plant pollinators, and they provide population control for a number of plants and insect species by eating them. They also serve as sustenance for other species. They act as a lower member of the food chain, they are eaten by a number of birds and even mice.

As populations of butterflies diminish, it will cause the populations of birds and other animals that rely on them as their food source to also diminish. This loss of the butterfly species is the beginning of a phenomenon known as the “butterfly effect.” The butterfly effect will continue to affect the whole ecosystem, working its way up the trophic levels. More than half of all invertebrates can be connected back to the butterfly on the food chain. The loss of this seemingly insignificant insect could potentially collapse entire ecosystems, not only by having lost a source of food for other species but other plant species will also be lost as there will be less pollination happening.

These beautiful coloured insects are attracted to a variety of different plants for a variety of reasons as well, we are going to discuss these plants that butterflies are attracted to, for those who like to see these creatures in their gardens, I am sure you will be eager to know these plant species so you can get them right away. Some of these plant species are already cultivated by some people but some are entirely wild.

One might have already guessed that the plants are flowers, but not all of them. This is because the reason the butterflies are attracted to the plants is very different. Butterflies need plants that produce nectar for adult butterflies to eat. Nectar is sugary solution flowers produce to promote pollination, it is a vital food source for adult butterflies so it’s no surprise that butterflies will be attracted to nectar-producing plants. They also need plants that provide food for caterpillars which are their offspring, it’s no surprise that they would want the best for their offspring as this is the case with most animal species, these plants are referred to as host plants. Without further ado let’s get right into the plant species.

1. Aster – this is a type of flower which grows upright up to a height of 6’. They have dozens of blooms on a single plant, making them fit into any garden if not make it better. It attracts a wide variety of butterfly species. Asters bring a variety of colours to your garden and they keep on blooming towards the end of the season when other plants have stopped flowering. The flower comes in colours of purple, blue, pink, red and white with varying sizes from short groundcovers to towering plants. With such a wide range of colours and sizes, it won’t be difficult to find the variety that fits into your garden. Different butterflies need this flower for different reasons, it is a host plant for Perl Crescents and [Silvery Checkerspot butterflies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlosyne_nycteis). They provide nectar for Sulphurs, Whites and Fritillaries. They bloom from the middle of the year to nearly the end of the year.
2. [Bee Balm](https://www.almanac.com/plant/bee-balm) – this flower is native to North-America and is known to attract a lot of bees but butterflies also fancy it a lot and not only these insects are attracted to this species as I also attract a group of some hummingbirds. They grow upright to an average height of about 4’ tall and produce very bright colour blooms which are a great source of nectar. This flower is deadheading, meaning after blooming the blooms die and this is good as it encourages a second round of blooms. There are a lot of cultivars available commercially and all have different colours with some having very slight variations. They have different hardness and tolerance but from the wide range, you are sure to find one for your region. It is a member of the mint family so it tends to spread once it's planted. It is a host plant for butterflies like Hermit Sphinx, Orange Mint Moth and Raspberry Pyrausta. They are a source of nectar for Whites, Hummingbird moths, Sulfurs, Swallowtails and Fritillaries. They bloom from midyear to nearly the end of the year. For interest's sake, their scientific name is [Monarda Didyma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarda_didyma).
3. [Black-Eyed Susan](https://www.almanac.com/plant/black-eyed-susans) – these are great at resisting drought and g4row in the wild in grand expanses. They have a bright yellow colour just like daisies which draws in a lot of butterflies searching for nectar. They don’t need special treatment as they can stand the hardest of conditions making them easy to grow. They are host plants for butterflies like Bordered Patch, Gorgone Checkerspot and Silvery Checkerspot. They also bloom from midyear to nearly the end of the year and their scientific name is [Rudbeckia Fulgida](https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=g630).
4. [Coneflower](https://www.gardendesign.com/flowers/coneflower.html) – this very common perennial blooms midsummer and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a great addition to gardens in hot climates. There are a few variations to this genus with just a handful of species. All the species in the genus share a common characteristic of stiffness, dryness and toughness. The plants can even be left standing over the winter for birds. This is definitely a genus to have in your garden as its roots when dried are used in herbal medicines and skincare products. They are host plants for Silvery Checkerspot and they provide nectar for a wide range of butterflies from small Skippers to large Swallowtails. They are known scientifically as Echinacea and bloom from midyear to almost the end of the year.
5. Goldenrod – this is a plant-primarily found in prairies and meadows. They have many useful properties and this is why they are found in most garden landscapes. They are late blooming and are known for their ability to attract butterflies and other pollinators, this is why they are better planted near gardens as they will draw insects away from the valuable plants as these insects will be running from becoming the prey of the butterflies. They provide nectar to mostly smaller butterflies but a few big butterflies like Tiger Swallowtails also collect nectar from them. They bloom from midyear to almost the end of the year and are known scientifically as Solidago.

## **CONCLUSION**

The biggest threat to butterflies is the lack of habitat to help them. We can cut on chemicals like pesticides and herbicides, and plant more flowers favourable to the butterflies. Of all the plant species discussed, the one that attracts the most butterflies is the Bee Balm, and it's one of the flowers you need in your garden if you want to venture into butterfly farming.
