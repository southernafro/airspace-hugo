      decisions. Smart Farmers Hub has a commitment to providing farmers with the
      latest research and articles pertaining to agriculture. We believe that these

    content: Food security is Africa ’s top priority. Providing farmers with the knowledge
      they need to grow crops and increasing food production in Africa is another
      major focus of Smart Farmers Hub. We believe that by providing farmers with
      tools and resources, food security can be achieved.  Impact on Society Bringing
      about changes in agricultural practices have positive effects on society as
      a whole. Our vision is to close the gap between growing population and availability
      of food through sustainable farming practices so that everyone has a chance
      to improve their quality of life.  South American farmers are facing the increasing
      severity of the climate change brought on by global warming. According to the
      UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the region was home to 1.9 billion
      people in 1994. By 2050, that number is expected to soar to 3.6 billion, and
      countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Madagascar, Mexico
      and Peru are being hit hard by a changing climate and lack of resources.  Indian
      farmers already have the worst problems with drought every year. As a result
      of climate change, they face a slight decrease in rainfall. This has led to
      an increase in the number of famine deaths during the last 3 consecutive years.  Undoubtedly,
      farmers in the region are experiencing tough times. Despite that, however, they
      are still determined to do everything they can to preserve their lives and their
      crops as well as that of their families. The Smart Farmers Hub is working to
      provide them with information on how they can get through these difficult times.

    content: "Accessibility is one of the main hurdles in our agricultural system.
      One of the main factors that makes us forget about the importance of accessibility
      is that we are able to access information quickly through technology.\n\nWith
      Smart Farmers Hub, we will allow farmers to take advantage of all the great
      resources available on the internet. We will make sure that they have full access
      to all relevant sources; whether they are scientific or not is unimportant. "
