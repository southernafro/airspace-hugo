  title: Agriculture Information
  content: We believe that access to proper information will help each individual
    farmer make decisions that will lead to higher crop yields and better farming
    practices. According to FAO [Organization of the United Nations for Food and Agriculture],
    “Agriculture is the most important sector in the food supply, accounting for one-third
    of total agricultural production.” Smart Farmers Hub strives to provide farmers
    with all the information needed to create sustainable farming practices.

  title: About Us
  description: Our goal for this website is to create a Hub where Smart Farmers can
    share their passion. We will research and test new development in farming so we
    can share them. Whether it is new equipment or techniques. Thank you for being
    a part of what we are doing. We would love to hear from you.
  content: Farming is one of the most important vocations. It has evolved from the
    sidelines at a time when most humans would have caught or grown their own food.
    Being able to purchase food from others has been a key factor in the developments
    that the world has made. As farmers, we have an important role to play.
